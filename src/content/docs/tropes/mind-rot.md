Mind Rot

[The Mind Rot effect](https://www.mtgcast.com/podcasts/the-blue-envelope-podcast/posts/the-blue-envelope-podcast-episode-48-the-mind-rot-effect-1fb5e2c04a)

Unlike its now iconic blue counterpart, this effect has been around since 1997. Portal.

Funny when people suddenly ask "How many cards in hand out of nowhere"
